# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Until v1.0.0, we support the latest minor release line.

| < 0.1.0 | No        |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do NOT create a public issue for security reports.

- Preferred: Open a private report via GitHub Security Advisories:
  https://github.com/Flowscape-UI/canvas-react/security/advisories/new
- Alternative: If you cannot use Advisories, email: nikcrav@gmail.com

We aim to:

- Acknowledge your report within 3 business days
- Provide a triage update within 7 business days
- Coordinate a fix and disclosure following responsible disclosure practices

## Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure. Once a fix is available and users have a reasonable
upgrade path, we will publish an advisory with credits. If you wish to remain anonymous,
please indicate that in your report.
